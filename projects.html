        <h2>Simulations Lead/Arm Team Mechanical Engineer - Robots for Space Exploration (RSX) - University of Toronto</h2>
        <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Fusion360, Solidworks, Python, C++, C#, Unity, Robotic Simulation</p>
        <p>RSX is a university design team developing a space rover to compete at competitions around the world. I am currently the simulations lead for RSX, where I have been developing simulation environments for testing of autonomous navigation algorithms, as well as building the basis for future projects developing AI agents for arm control and autonomous task completion. As a mechanical engineer on the arm subteam, I was repsonsible for designing, testing, and manufacturing four out of six total degrees of freedom of a robotic arm. </p>

        <h2>Team Lead - Deep Learning Based Alzheimer's Diagnostics Using Electroencephalagram (EEG) Data - University of Toronto</h2>
        <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Python (PyTorch, NumPy, MNE Python)</p>
        <p>Early stage Alzheimer's diagnosis is critical to effective treatment and preservation of quality of life. Existing techniques are typically invasive or are inaccurate at early stages of the condition. My team and I leveraged EEG data to detect deviations in brain activity in Alzheimer's patients, providing a non-invasive method through which patients can get tested. I was personally responsible for the processing of EEG data (artifact removal, ICA, etc.) as well as assisting in the development and tuning of the deep learning model, which achieved a final test accuracy of 73%.</p>

        <h2>Team Member - Investigation of Spaceflight Conditions on C. Elegans Worms Using Digital Twin - NASA Space Apps</h2>
        <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Python, Linux</p>
        <p>My team developed a physics inspired neural network (PINN) to map the effects of spaceflight conditions on the phenotype of c. elegans worm. This was done using genotype data of spaceflight c. elegans worms, specifically the distinction between worms exhibitng a homological equivalent to Duschenne's muscular dystrophy and wild-type genotypes. Using the correlation between spaceflight and this condition, we adjusted 20 different digital twin parameters in the OpenWorm model and used the PINN to identify map the overall correlation of spaceflight to the movement of the digital twin. The project was awarded second place overall in the Toronto local event and finished top 100 in global judging of 5500+ teams total</p>
